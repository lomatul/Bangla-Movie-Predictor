# Bengali Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for our machine learning project in the CSE 4554 Machine Learning Lab at Islamic University of Technology, Gazipur. We focused on building a Bengali movie recommendation system, collecting data, creating a dataset, and training various machine learning models to evaluate their performance.

### Data Collection

We collected data on Bengali movies from various sources and used techniques like youtube api calls to extract relevant information. The dataset includes movieId, title, storyline, trailerLink source_trailer, genre, director, starring, releasedYear, runtime, IMDB avg rating, no of users (who rated), views, likes, comments, trailerPublishedAt.

### Project Implementation

The implementation of the project was done and described in Google Colab (the link is provided above). We visualized the data and the relationship between the features, we then processed the data and trained 4 machine learning models on it.



## Machine learning Models

After careful deliberation we have decided to implement the following models

- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression


## Usage

The results of the models are fully replicable. Kindly refer to the Google Colab file and the report for further details
